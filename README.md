'Dont miss a moment... .js, get it?'

A day planner web app. Keep track of meetings, or any event during the day by the hour. Time blocks change color based on the hour, so you can really keep track of time, at a glance. Using 'jquery' and 'moment.js' (a depricated js library used to tell time/date) this app will help you be more organized, and allow you to not miss a moment... .js. (never gets old).
